# Caesar Cipher

Caesar Cipher, also known as **Shift Cipher**, **Caesar's Code** or **Caesar Shift** is one of the simplest, widely known and used encryption technique or algorithm. It is a type of encryption algorithm in which the plain text shifts or changes to a different one when encrypted. The number or level of shifts are fixed for all characters throughout the plain text which can be specified as per the requirement. The code above is dedicated towards the shift of 4 characters.

### Example:

- **Text** : THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
- **Shift** : 4
- **Cipher** : XLI UYMGO FVSAR JSB NYQTW SZIV XLI PEDC HSK

***Note:*** *The shift can be set to follow the direction that the user desires for cipher conversion. **For Example:** The character **A** can be converted to either **E** or **W** depending on whether the shift is set to **4** or **-4**. While in case of decryption, the shift is in the exact opposite direction as that of encryption.*
