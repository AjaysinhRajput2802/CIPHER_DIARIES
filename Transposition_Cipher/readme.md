# Tranposition Cipher

## Encryption
The Transposition Cipher encrypts by rearranging the order of the letters in the ciphertext according to a predetermined method. This is done by picking a matrix of a fixed size, such as 8x10 and then writing the letters of the message across the rows of the matrix. The message is enciphered when the leters are written as one goes down the columns in the matrix. For example, if we want to encode: The Github repository has stopped working, we can choose a 4x10 matrix to hold the 36 letters in our message. The 4 extra spaces can befilled with dummy letters, which we will use "x" for. Here is an example below: 

| | | | | | | | | | 
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
T| h| e | G | i | t | h | u | b |
I | A | A | A | A | A | A | A | A |
