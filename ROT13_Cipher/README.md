# ROT13 Cipher

ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated **ROT-13**) is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. It is a special case of the Caesar cipher with shift equal to 13.

### Example:

- **Text** : WHY DID THE CHICKEN CROSS THE ROAD? GB TRG GB GUR BGURE FVQR!
- **Cipher** : JUL QVQ GUR PUVPXRA PEBFF GUR EBNQ? TO GET TO THE OTHER SIDE!

***Note:*** *Because there are 26 letters (2Ã—13) in the basic Latin alphabet, ROT13 is its own inverse; that is, to undo ROT13, the same algorithm is applied, so the same action can be used for encoding and decoding. The algorithm provides virtually no cryptographic security, and is often cited as a canonical example of weak encryption.*
