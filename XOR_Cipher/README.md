# XOR Cipher

XOR (pronounced “exclusive or”) cipher is an additive cypher. It is based on the XOR operation (also known as the exclusive disjunction) in logic.

As a logical operation, XOR is also called modulus 2 addition. In XOR operation, the output is true when the inputs differ. In other words, XOR operation means “either one but not both or none.”

XOR cipher employs the XOR logical operation in order to encrypt data. First, a random key is generated. Then, XOR operation is performed using the key so that an encrypted data is created. In order to decrypt, the same key should be used and XOR operation should be run again.

XOR operation uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. That is why it is known as a symmetric encryption.
